# Big O

- Why Big O
  - we need a metric to evaluate algorithms
  - Using time is not accountable
    - different machine
    - the same machine may give different timing cost
  - So we can switch direction on counting operations
- Big O is a metric to evaluate algorithms.
  - We can assess algorithms from two dimensions
    - time (complexity)
    - space (complexity) ( focus on auxiliary space)
  - Based on limitations and needs, big O can also be a evaluation to make trade-off when choosing an algorithm
  - Def: [In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)
    - constant: o(1)
    - linear: o(n)
    - quadratic: o(n2)

## Side Notes

1. check the time cost in Chrome for Javascript

```javascript
const startTime = time.performance();
const result = getResult();
const nowTime = time.performance();

console.info(nowTime - startTime);
```
