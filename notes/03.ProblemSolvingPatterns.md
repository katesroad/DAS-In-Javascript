# Problem Solving Patterns

- Frequency patterns
  - array
  - string
- Multiple Pointers Pattern (Sorted)
  - search a pair of values that match some condition
  - Def: create a pairs of pointer move towards a direction based on some condition
    - center
    - end
    - begin
- Sliding window pattern
- Divde and conquer pattern: comes in the following charpter
