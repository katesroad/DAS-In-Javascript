# Problem-solving pattern

## Type of problems and general problem solution

- Two types of problems

  - The basic approach to solving a problem you don't need how to solve
  - Problem with problem-solving patterns

- Strategy
  - Design a plan for solving a problem
  - master common problem-solving patterns
- A general solution
  - understand the problem
  - explore a concrete example
  - break it down
  - solve or simplify
  - look back and refactor

## Dive into steps

- understand the problem
  - Can I restate the problem in my own words
  - what are the inputs that go into the problem
  - what the outputs should come from the solution to the problem
  - can the input determine the outputs? In other words, do I have enough information
  - How should I label the important piece of data that are part of the problem
- Come up with a concrete example
  - start with a simple example
  - progress with a complex example
  - progress with empty input
  - progress with invalid input
- Break the problem down
- Solve or simplify
  - why: interviewer wants to see your process
  - gain insight from this process

```javascript
const countCharacters = (inputString) => {
  const countMap = {};

  const lowerCasedString = inputString.toLowercase();

  for (let i = 0, len = lowerCasedString.length; i < len; i++) {
    const curCharacter = lowerCasedString[i];

    if (countMap[curCharacter]) {
      countMap[curCharacter] += 1;
    } else {
      countMap[curCharacter] = 1;
    }
  }

  return countMap;
};
```
